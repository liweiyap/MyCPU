## User Guide

Compilation of `myCPU.cpp` relies on the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system. The code has been tested with recent versions of the [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/) C++ compiler. To compile and run, execute the following, starting in the root of the repository:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make all
./myCPU
```
